## New Features - Coming Soon


## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your computer. Additionally, MongoDB should be installed and running locally or be accessible through a remote connection.

### Installing Dependencies

You can install the required npm packages for the React frontend by running the following command in your project's root directory:

This will install the following dependencies:

    npm install

#### Axios: 
Axios is used for making HTTP requests from the React app.
#### React Router DOM:
React Router DOM is used for handling routing within the React frontend.
#### Ant Design (antd):
Ant Design is a popular UI framework for React, providing a range of UI components and styles.

    npm install axios react-router-dom antd

For the Express.js backend and MongoDB, navigate to the server directory and install the backend dependencies:

    cd server
    npm install


### Setting Up MongoDB
Ensure that MongoDB is running. You may need to customize the MongoDB connection settings in the server/config/db.js file to match your MongoDB configuration.

### Running the App
Once the dependencies are installed, you can start both the React frontend and Express.js backend concurrently by running the following command in both the client and server directory:

    npm start

This will start both the frontend and backend servers. The React app will be accessible in your web browser at http://localhost:3000, and the Express.js API will be available at http://localhost:3001.

Now you're ready to begin working on your full-stack project, which combines the power of React, Express.js, and MongoDB!
